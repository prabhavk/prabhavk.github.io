In work presented here I have analyzed the impact of initial parameters on the final log likelihood scores obtained by optimizing GMM using EM.
 The initial parameters were set using (i) Dirichlet distribution,
 (ii) maximum parsimony,
 and (iii) reparameterized GMM parameters yielding a maximum log likelihood score.
 EM was performed 100 times with the root placed at each internal node.
 The EM method is referred to as EMtr in this paper,

A maximum log likelihood score of -4363.9238 was obtained in runs where the Dirichlet distribution was used to set initial parameters.
 Similar maximum log likelihood scores were achieved for each location of the root ranging from .
 A maximum log likelihood score of -4364.9987 was obtained if parsimony was used to set initial parameters.
 However,
 unlike the results obtained using Dirichlet allocated parameters,
 there was considerable instability in the results obtained using parsimony.
 If one uses reparameterized maximum likelihood estimate of GMM then EM started with root at any internal node does not improve the log likelihood score,
 confirming that one should not try to identify the location of the root by maximizing the log likelihood score using the general Markov model.
 Additionally,
 a null hypothesis about the distribution of recall values for a topology,
 generated by placing the root at arbitrary internal nodes suggests that the recall values presented in

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an unrooted phylogenetic tree,
 a general Markov model is constructed by selecting an internal node as the root,
 orienting all edges away from the root,
 defining a probability vector for the root,
 and a transition (conditional probability) matrix for each directed edge.
 The general Markov model (GMM) was introduced to phylogenetics by Barry and Hartigan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Barry1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In their paper,
 Barry and Hartigan describe an expectation algorithm in which GMM is parameterized in terms of joint probability distributions for variables represented by the endpoints of each edge;
 their algorithm has been implemented by Jayaswal and colleagues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jayaswal2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 An EM algorithm that parameterizes GMM in terms of a probability distribution at the root and a transition matrix for each edge,
 called EMtree has been implemented by Ibanez-Marcelo and Casanellas.
 The authors applied EMtree in order to infer quartet trees,
 i.e.,
 trees with four leaves.
 I implemented EM in K2020 involved adapting Friedman's algorithm for tree search using structural EM for the general time-reversible model (GTR)

Steel and colleagues prove that given a GMM that is rooted at an internal node,
 it is possible to move the root to an adjacent internal node,
 and modify the root probability vector and the transition matrices associated with edges whose directions have changed,
 such that the joint probability distribution remains unchanged.

Proof by Allman and Rhodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof by Allman and Rhodes states that,
 given a GMM defined for root at some node of a topology,
 there exist GMM with roots at alternate nodes,
 such that it is possible to obtain the same expected frequency of site patterns (unique columns in a matrix of aligned sequences) at any node.
 See Proposition 1 in~
\backslash
cite{allman_rhodes_2003}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from the proofs of Steel and colleagues,
 and Allman and Rhodes,
 that the log likelihood score computed by conditioning the joint probability distribution using states observed in an alignment,
 and summing over hidden states at internal nodes,
 would be identical for GMM constructed at alternate nodes using the SSH method.

Distribution of optimization scores across root locations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With final log likelihood scores ranging from [] to [],
 and [] to [],
 it appears that initializing parameters using Dirichlet distribution and SSH,
 respectively,
 yields similar log-likelihood scores across root locations (see in Fig.
 ).
 The log likelihood score obtained by parameters initialized using ancestral states inferred using maximum parsimony seem more unevenly distributed with higher log likelihood scores obtained at nodes [] (see in Fig.
 ).
 Nodes [] are located adjacent to each other in the experimental phylogeny (see Supplementary Figure 1 of Randall and colleagues) suggesting that repeated inference with parsimony yields a consensus rooting,
 which should not be trusted because of the reparamterization property of GMM.

Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an input topology and a fixed location of the root,
 Expectation-Maximization (EM) was used to optimize the parameters of GMM.
 Parameters of GMM were initialized either using (i) states inferred with maximum parsimony which were then used to compute estimates of root probability and transition (conditional) probability or (ii) drawn from Dirichlet distributions,
 and (iii) reparameterized GMM using a MLE of GMM that were obtained in this study.
 After initialization a maximum of 1000 iterations of EM were performed.
 The E step involves construction of a clique tree,
 and computation of marginal probabilities for variable pair represented by each edge,
 and the variable represented by each hidden node.
 Marginal probabilities were used to computed expected number of co-occurring states for each edge,
 and the expected number of states for each node.
 Next,
 in the M step,
 the expected counts were used to compute the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of root probability and transition matrices.
 A threshold of 5E-4 was used to decide the convergence of expected complete-data log likelihood score,
 failing which,
 the maximum number of EM iterations was capped at 1000.
 100 repetitions of EM were performed for each location of the root.

Reproducibility of Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to enable the reproducibility of results shown in this paper,
 we built a web application with Next.js (App Router) and React using TypeScript throughout for type safety and linting.
 Interactive figures (ECD-LL curves,
 histograms,
 and Rhodonea curves) are rendered client-side with Plotly via react-plotly.js,
 and users can export publication-quality images using Plotly.toImage.
 Styling is done with Tailwind CSS.
 Statistical comparisons (e.g.,
 Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney) are computed in Next.js API routes running on Node.js,
 using a lightweight database layer (@/lib/db) to read per-job/per-root/per-method results stored in SQL tables.
 Upstream preprocessing—
such as tree manipulation and cluster extraction for performing the non-parametric test for recall values—
is performed in Python using NetworkX.
 The client communicates with the server via JSON fetch calls,
 and only nonessential UI state (e.g.,
 selected job) is cached in localStorage to keep analyses reproducible.
 The text listed in this subsection so far along with majority of the code used to build the web application was generated using ChatGPT v5 (personal communication,

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Log likelihood scores obtained by initializing parameters using Dirichlet distribution and SSH are similar across root locations whereas parsimony tends to select a root location at nodes [].
 However the maximum log likelihood score obtained by parsimony is significantly smaller than those obtained by initializing GMM using Dirichlet distributed parameters and reparameterized SSH parameters.
 In any case,
 the reparameterization property of GMM is confirmed computationally using reparameterized models defined at different locations of the root obtained using Bayes' rule as described in the SSH paper,
 confirming that the root is not identifiable using the general Markov model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rooting a tree at an arbitrarily selected node yields large recall values of 0.8 suggesting that it is necessary to perform a statistical test to account for large recall values obtained at nodes that may be distant from the real location of the root.
 As the unrooted topology was rooted at internal nodes and not along branches the maximum recall value is not 1.0 as only 16 of the 17 clusters in the experimental rooted tree can be recovered,
 the recall values obtained in the null hypothesis will be 0.94 at most.
 Additionally,
 the recall value obtained in the preprint was based on an inferred topology that differed from the actual topology of the experimental data so it would be smaller than 0.94 with a maximum value depending on the number of splits that are recovered.
 Nevertheless the recall value of 0.82 that is reported in the preprint should not be taken as evidence of having obtained a realistically rooted tree.
 A p-value of 0.5 was obtained for the recall values of 0.82 using a non-parametric test suggesting that recall values obtained using any method that infers rooted trees should be tested for statistical significance,
 in addition to the root being identifiable with respect to the assumptions of the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion,
 one should not infer rooted trees using the general Markov model.
 If one is interested in optimizing the parameters of GMM then results suggest that it is preferable to draw initial values from the Dirichlet distribution and not use initial parameters obtained with ancestral states inferred using the maximum parsimony criterion.
